i started this project a while ago trying to learn computers better. 

proxmox:
  the NAS is no longer a bare metal machine, it is not virtualized under proxmox. the reason for this was the new LTO library. it required direct hardware passthrough where it would have been a hastle to impossible to achieve in the existing unraid install
  

LTO library:
  IBM 3100
  LTO 6 tape (sas)
  

k3s cluster
  mqtt
  cloudflare DDNS
  



rancher
  i dont like CLI stuff so i use rancher

mosquitto
  i needed a mqtt broker for meshtastic and to get this working at its most ideallized state required it ve in a docker, on my cluster, with a DDNS, through my custom domain
